#### Description

framer2AE is a tool to rebuild Sketch projects in AE, based on a Framerjs export.

-----------------------
#### Usage

From Sketch, export your project to framer. This should give you a folder structure.
Somewhere within there, you'll find a file called 'layers.json'

In AE, run the script, and select 'layers.json'.
The script should build out an AE project matching what you had in Sketch.

-----------------------
#### Installation

Copy "zl_FramerToAE.jsxbin" to your ScriptUI Panels folder, usually here:

* PC:	C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\
* Mac:	\Applications\Adobe After Effects CC\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\

If the ScriptUI Panels folder does not exist, create it.
